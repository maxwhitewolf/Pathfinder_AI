# ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to all those who supported us throughout the development of PathfinderAI. We sincerely thank our project guide for their invaluable guidance, continuous encouragement, and technical expertise that shaped this research. We are grateful to the faculty members of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering for their technical insights and unwavering support.

We acknowledge Google for providing access to the Gemini AI API, which enabled the intelligent resume parsing, skill extraction, and personalized career guidance features of our platform. We also express our appreciation to the open-source community for the excellent libraries and frameworks—FastAPI, React, Scikit-learn, and Gensim—that formed the foundation of our system.

We are thankful to our peers who provided valuable feedback during the development process, helping us refine the user experience and improve the machine learning models. Their constructive criticism and suggestions were instrumental in enhancing the platform's functionality.

Finally, we extend our deepest gratitude to our families for their unwavering support and patience throughout this endeavor. Their encouragement and understanding during the long hours of development and testing were essential to the successful completion of this project.
