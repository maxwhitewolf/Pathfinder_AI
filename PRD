Product Requirements Document
PathFinder AI – Adaptive Career Intelligence Platform with Reinforcement Learning and RAG

1. Product Overview
   PathFinder AI is an adaptive AI-powered career guidance and learning platform designed to help users transition from their current skill level to job readiness for specific target roles. The system ingests job descriptions and user resumes to generate structured, job-specific learning roadmaps using a Large Language Model (LLM). Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) layers are integrated on top of this foundation to continuously personalize roadmap progression, recommendations, and career guidance based on user behavior, learning outcomes, and external signals. The platform evolves from a static roadmap generator into an adaptive AI career coach.

2. Problem Statement
   Current AI career guidance systems generate static learning paths that do not adapt to individual learner differences. Users targeting the same role receive identical roadmaps regardless of prior knowledge, learning speed, or struggles. This results in inefficient learning, disengagement, and longer time to job readiness. Additionally, generic LLM responses lack grounding in platform-specific data and user history, and existing ML components are not fully functional or integrated. There is a need for a system that preserves job-driven curriculum integrity while dynamically adapting learning order, difficulty, and guidance per user.

3. Goals and Objectives
   The primary goal is to implement a robust RL and RAG layer on top of an existing LLM-based roadmap generation system without altering the roadmap generation logic itself. Objectives include:

* Personalizing roadmap progression per user based on interaction feedback.
* Continuously learning optimal task sequencing and difficulty adjustments using RL.
* Providing contextual, grounded AI guidance using RAG across jobs, roadmaps, and resumes.
* Enabling job comparison, resume validation, and in-context career chat.
* Transitioning from non-functional or placeholder ML components to a working, review-ready implementation by the specified deadline.

4. Scope of the System
   In Scope:

* LLM-based job-specific roadmap generation (existing functionality).
* Reinforcement Learning layer for adaptive roadmap progression.
* Contextual bandit implementation for task recommendation and phase reordering.
* RAG layer for grounding LLM outputs in internal data.
* AI Career Chat, Job Comparison, Resume & Skill Validator features.
* Backend APIs, database schema extensions, and frontend integration hooks.

Out of Scope:

* Replacing or redesigning the initial roadmap generation logic.
* Full-scale deep RL with long-horizon planning beyond contextual bandits.
* External job application automation.

5. Functional Requirements

5.1 Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Layer

* The system shall treat the LLM-generated roadmap as a fixed base curriculum per job description.
* The system shall capture user interactions at task and subtask level, including feedback buttons (start, finished, need easier, skip, already know), time spent, clicks, and revisits.
* The system shall convert interaction data into a user state representation reflecting strengths and weaknesses across skills and difficulties.
* The system shall implement a contextual bandit model where:

  * Context represents the user’s current roadmap and skill state.
  * Actions represent recommendations such as next task selection, reordering phases, inserting prerequisite tasks, skipping known content, or adjusting difficulty.
  * Rewards are computed based on user feedback and engagement outcomes.
* The system shall continuously update and retrain the RL policy using accumulated interaction data.

5.2 AI Career Chat

* The system shall embed an AI copilot powered by Gemini on job and roadmap pages.
* The copilot shall answer user questions using RAG, grounded in job data, roadmap tasks, and user profile.
* The copilot shall provide personalized guidance without altering the core roadmap generation.

5.3 Job Comparison

* The system shall provide a side-by-side comparison of multiple jobs.
* Comparison attributes shall include match score, required skills, estimated roadmap effort, salary range, and location.
* Data shall be derived from job descriptions, internal job metadata, and user profile alignment.

5.4 Resume and Skill Validator

* The system shall analyze user resumes against selected job descriptions using Gemini.
* The system shall identify missing keywords and skill gaps.
* The system shall propose resume bullet improvements and learning actions mapped to the user’s roadmap.

6. Non-Functional Requirements

* Scalability: The system must support incremental growth in users, tasks, and interaction logs.
* Performance: RL recommendations must be generated within acceptable response times for interactive use.
* Reliability: Roadmap generation must function independently of RL availability.
* Maintainability: RL and RAG components must be modular and replaceable.
* Security: Sensitive user data and tokens must be encrypted and access-controlled.

7. System Architecture Overview
   The architecture consists of a frontend client, a backend application server, ML/RL services, and a data layer. The backend orchestrates LLM calls for roadmap generation, persists normalized roadmap tasks, logs user interactions, builds state vectors, and queries the RL policy for recommendations. A RAG service maintains embeddings and retrieval logic to enrich LLM prompts. Background workers synchronize external data sources and retrain RL models offline.

8. Data Sources and Datasets

* Job descriptions and job metadata stored internally.
* User profiles, resumes, and roadmap interaction logs.
* Normalized task and phase data derived from LLM-generated roadmaps.
* External datasets from GitHub activity, coding platforms, and learning platforms.
* Curated internal documents and knowledge bases for RAG.

9. AI/ML Models and Algorithms

* LLM: Gemini for roadmap generation, career chat, and resume analysis.
* Reinforcement Learning: Contextual bandit model with epsilon-greedy exploration.
* Feature Engineering: State vectors combining user profile, roadmap progress, engagement metrics, and external signals.
* RAG: Embedding models for semantic retrieval and grounding of LLM prompts.
* Training: Offline batch training with incremental updates from logged interactions.

10. Third-Party Integrations

* Gemini APIs for generation and embeddings.
* GitHub APIs for repository and activity data.
* Coding platforms such as LeetCode and HackerRank.
* Learning platforms such as Udemy and Coursera.

11. User Experience Flow

* User selects or inputs a job description.
* System generates a static, job-specific roadmap via LLM.
* User interacts with roadmap tasks and provides feedback.
* RL layer adapts task ordering and recommendations in real time.
* AI Career Chat provides contextual guidance alongside roadmap views.
* User can compare jobs and validate resumes at any point.

12. Alerting and Notification Logic

* Notify users when adaptive recommendations are updated.
* Alert users when significant skill gaps or readiness milestones are detected.
* Optional reminders based on inactivity or stalled progress.

13. Analytics and Reporting

* Track task completion rates, feedback distributions, and engagement metrics.
* Monitor RL reward trends and policy performance.
* Report job outcome correlations with learning paths.

14. Security and Privacy Considerations

* Encrypt resumes, access tokens, and personal data.
* Ensure compliance with data protection standards.
* Allow users to opt in or out of external data integrations.

15. Deployment Strategy

* Phase-based rollout: logging first, heuristics next, contextual bandit thereafter.
* Deploy RL models as versioned artifacts.
* Use background jobs for retraining and data synchronization.

16. Assumptions and Constraints

* The initial roadmap generation logic remains unchanged.
* User feedback is assumed to be honest and representative.
* External platform integrations may be limited by API availability.
* Full deep RL is deferred due to timeline constraints.

17. Success Metrics

* Reduction in average time to task completion.
* Increased task completion and reduced skip rates.
* Improved job readiness indicators and job outcomes.
* User engagement and retention metrics.

18. Risks and Mitigation

* Risk: Insufficient data for RL learning. Mitigation: Start with heuristics and gradual exploration.
